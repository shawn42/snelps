MILESTONE #1 - "move units here" campaign
 - create ability panel in gui to display currently available abilities
 - create Element class to parent Button,Checkbox,StoryStack
 - Maps need to know if X,Y has an obsticle
   - tile number ranges? (http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article728.asp)
 - add structure placement "grid-locking"
 - add abilities to units (maybe not needed for this milestone)
 - add simple intro UI (map selection)
 - clean up and add docs EVERYWHERE
 - add images to story stacks

PROBLEMS
 - how will things handle images larger than the size of a tile?
 - new selection code doesn't allow the player to send a unit to the portal

BACKLOG
