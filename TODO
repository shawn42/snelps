MILESTONE #1 - "move units here" campaign
 - maps should contain a list of entities to start the map with
   - remove random unit creation from campaign_mode.rb
   - create an target_zone entity for completion of first map
 - create Element class to parent Button,Checkbox,StoryStack
 - Maps need to know if X,Y has an obsticle
   - tile number ranges? (http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article728.asp)
 - player connects and unit/structure creation needs to be sent to the network
 - add structure placement "grid-locking"
 - add abilities to units (maybe not needed for this milestone)
 - add simple intro UI (map selection)
 - clean up and add docs EVERYWHERE

PROBLEMS
 - coords_to_tiles/unit placement is off

BACKLOG
 - add logger to app
